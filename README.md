# kolor 

> kolor is a bot that interact with Twitch and Discord.  


This is a significant overhaul of the Kolor bot that I created several years ago. The original codebase was subpar and lacked the structure and organization. In response, I've decided to completely remake the bot from the ground up with a focus on creating a well-structured and organized codebase. The new codebase is designed to be more modular, making it easier to update and maintain in the future.
